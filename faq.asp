          <a href="#"><span>What does it cost to sell on priceBay?</span></a>
          <div class="answer"><strong>priceBay does not make charges or Basic Fees such as Insertion Fees and Final Value Fees. An Insertion Fee is charged when you list an item on eBay.</strong> If the item sells, you're charged a final value fee. Final value fees are calculated based on the <strong>total amount of the sale</strong> and are charged per item. The total amount of the sale is the final price of the item, shipping charges, and any other amounts you may charge the buyer. Sales tax is not included.  
<P>There are also Optional Fees (Advanced listing upgrade fees and Supplemental service fees) if you add advanced listing upgrades to your listing or use supplemental services.  See details <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/questions/what-fees.html">here</a>.  However, on priceBay there is no charge</P>

          <a href="#"><span>To make sure priceBay is a place where sellers want to do business, and to manage buyer expectations, our unpaid items policy sets out our rules around paying for items after a buyer has won an auction or agreed to make a purchase.  What are these rules?</span></a>
          <div class="answer">When a buyer bids on an item or selects Buy It Now, they're committing to paying for the item. If they don't pay within 2 days, the seller can open an unpaid item case in the Resolution Center. If the case closes without payment, the seller is eligible for a final value fee credit and we may record an unpaid item on the buyer's account. For more details on how unpaid item cases are resolved, please see our full policy guidelines below.  <pre>Final value fees are charged whether a sale is completed or not. However, in some circumstances, you might be eligible for a final value fee credit if there's a problem with the transaction.

To qualify for a final value fee credit, you need to resolve a return, refund, or cancellation request from your buyer, or open an unpaid item case in the Resolution Center.

If you qualify, we'll credit your final value fee to your seller account after any issues are resolved.

You may be eligible for a final value fee credit when:

    You and the buyer agree to cancel the sale
    The buyer doesn't pay and you report it as an unpaid item
    You resolve a transaction issue and refund the buyer

You'll see the credit on your statement or you can view it in your Account Summary - opens in new window or tab.

You can either leave this credit in your account and use it to pay future fees, or you can request a refund and we'll send you the money. You can only request a refund if you have a credit balance on your account.</pre></div>

          <a href="#"><span>How do I choose the right listing format? </span></a>
          <div class="answer">
                    Here are some general guidelines to help you select the best format for you items.
                    <br><br>
Choose <strong>Auction-style</strong> when:
<ul>
<li><strong>You're unsure of the value of your item</strong> and want it to sell right away, allowing the eBay Marketplace to determine its value.
<li>You have <strong>unique and hard-to-find items</strong> that could attract demand and spur a bidding war, maximizing profits from your listing.
<li>You are currently using Auction-style listings and you have a <strong>high sell-through rate </strong>(your items typically sell the first time you list them).
<li><strong>You sell sporadically</strong> and your items don't have recent sales to boost your item's search standing. Auction-style listings will have the option to be sorted by "Ending Soonest".
<li><a href="https://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fixed-price.html">Add Buy It Now to your Auction-style listings</a> and give buyers the option to purchase your item immediately or place a bid. Your listings will appear when buyers browse and search for items when clicking on both the <strong>Auctions only</strong> or <strong>Buy It Now only</strong> tabs in search results.
</ul>

Choose <strong>fixed price</strong> when:
<ul>
<li>You have <strong>multiple items</strong> that you can place into <strong>one listing</strong>.
<li>You know the <strong>value of your item</strong> or know the exact price you need to get for it.
<li>You have a <strong>lot of inventory</strong> and want to minimize your upfront Insertion Fees.
<li>You want your items to be available to buyers for <strong>more than seven or 10 days</strong>.
</UL>

Use a <strong>combination of both</strong> Auction-style and fixed price by adding Buy It Now when:
<ul>
<li>You sell a <strong>variety of items</strong> and want to <strong>attract both bidders and buyers</strong> - those looking for a deal on Auction-style listings and others who prefer the convenience of Fixed Price purchases.
<li>You want to <strong>maximize demand for your inventory</strong> and leverage Auction-style and Fixed Price to help drive bidders and buyers to your other listings.
</ul>

                <li class="question">
          <a href="#"><span>What types of listings count toward my free insertion fee limit?</span></a>
          <div class="answer">The following count toward your free limit:
                    <UL>
<li>New listings
<li>Relisted items&mdash;per listing&mdash;when eligible under our guidelines and site policies. Note this also includes any existing Good 'Til Cancelled listings. These are counted in each month's allotment at the time they automatically renew.
<li>Listings that you <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/end_early.html">end early</a>, or we end early due to an eBay policy violation or other reason
<li><a href="https://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/duplicate-listing.html">Duplicate identical Auction-style listings</a> (even if one or more of those listings doesn't appear on eBay)

          <a href="#"><span>How will I know how many of my free insertion fee listings have been used per month?</span></a>

          <a href="#"><span>Will my number of free insertion fee listings be affected if I take advantage of a pricing promotion?</span></a>
          <div class="answer">You'll be able to list up to the amount that the promotion provides throughout the duration of the promotion without impacting your normal number of monthly free insertion fee listings. For example, let's say you're a seller without an eBay Stores subscription who has been invited to participate in a 3-day promotion to list up to 100 items Auction-style free. So far this month, you've used of 10 of your monthly free insertion fee listings. Per the specifics of the promotion, you can list up to 100 items Auction-style free (no insertion fees) during the time of the promotion, and still have your remaining allotment of 40 free insertion fee non-promotional listings to use throughout the course of the month.</div>
